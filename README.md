# SoulsOutfitManager
 
SoulsOutfitManager is a work in progress python program for easy managing of Souls part mods such as ones that change the apperance of your armor or weapons.
It will allow you to easily manage replacements, and revert those changes without needing to repack with UXM or sort them yourself.
There will also be a feature to change the model masks of armor pieces while the game is running, and save the preferences to a file.
 
## Support
Currently, it is only being worked on for DARK SOULS III, and will be intended to be used with [UXM](https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/26)!, and later Mod Engine and ModEngine2. Support for other games such as DARK SOULS: REMASTERED may be considered after.

## How to use
Releases are intended to be in EXE form, but so far the source has been written in Python 3.7.8, so you'll need at least that version likely to run it.
